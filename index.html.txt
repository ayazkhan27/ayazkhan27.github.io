            <h2>Number Theorem for Cyclic Sequences</h2>
            <p>
                The "Number Theorem for Cyclic Sequences" project showcases a significant advancement in the field of number theory and its application to cryptography. Ayaz Khan derived and verified a theorem focusing on the minimal digit movement in cyclic sequences, which are crucial for understanding the properties of numbers in modular arithmetic systems. This project involved implementing sophisticated algorithms to generate and analyze cyclic sequences, specifically focusing on the properties of full reptend primes. These primes are known for their extensive repeating decimal expansions, which make them highly suitable for cryptographic applications. By creating detailed visualizations, Ayaz demonstrated the high success rates of the theorem across various tested primes, proving its robustness and potential for securing digital communications.
